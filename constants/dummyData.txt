Answer 04:

Content:
Sharding is a database scaling strategy used to distribute data across multiple servers or clusters to improve performance and handle large volumes of data. Here are some pros and cons of sharding in MongoDB:
Pros:
1. Horizontal scalability: Sharding allows MongoDB to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple shards, enabling the database to handle increased load and storage capacity.
2. Improved performance: Sharding can improve read and write performance by distributing data and query load across multiple shards, reducing the impact of heavy workloads on a single server.

How to do code parsing in DevFlow?

Content:
I'm testing code parsing:
export function formatBigNumber(number: number): string {
  if (number >= 1000000) {
    return (number / 1000000).toFixed(1) + "M";
  } else if (number >= 1000) {
    return (number / 1000).toFixed(1) + "k";
  } else {
    return number.toString();
  }
}
Hey guys, is this function correct?

Answer 05:

Content:
The function `formatBigNumber` appears to be correct for formatting large numbers into a human-readable format. It checks if the input number is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 and returns the number divided by 1,000,000 with one decimal place and the suffix "M" (for million). If the number is between 1,000 and 1,000,000, it returns the number divided by 1,000 with one decimal place and the suffix "k" (for thousand). If the number is less than 1,000, it returns the original number as a string. The function seems to handle the formatting logic appropriately. However, it's always a good practice to thoroughly test the function with various input values to ensure its correctness.
